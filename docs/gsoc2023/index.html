helps programmers develop large, production-ready projects faster by presenting
interactive coding (e.g., Jupyter) on a hierarchical, scoped, 2D canvas. Without
code modularization (traditionally done via organizing text files under
tree-structured folder hierarchies), a Jupyter notebook can easily become messy,
difficult to manage and scale. Alleviating such limitations, CodePod was born to
bump interactive coding beyond prototyping and demos. Our website is
<a href="https://codepod.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://codepod.io</a>. More details are in our paper:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02410</a></p><p>We are a VC-backed startup dedicated to open-source development tools. Both of

manage an entire repo as a whole. VCS has always been a challenge in
computational notebooks as there are no longer files. CodePod’s unique nested
scope canvas offers an opportunity to develop a finer-grained VCS by branching
at the scope level, instead of the repo level. In particular, users can create a
branch for any scope, and others can pull and merge the branch or switch
revisions. In addition (optional for this project), we’d like to support
collaborative editing and VCS at the same time to further improve the
effectiveness of teamwork.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: a version control system that can create branches on the
Scoped code cells. Should support branching, merging, and conflict-resolving
operations. Users can track changes and view the diff for each pod.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, React, GraphQL, WebSocket,

automation. But in interactive coding, there are no files but only snippets of
code (code cells). CodePod’s unique nested scope canvas offers yet another
opportunity to develop a function-level CI/CD pipeline. The pipelines should be
tightly integrated with the Canvas system.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: a CI/CD pipeline that can be triggered by releasing or
exporting. The pipeline should be function-level, for example, triggering a unit
test of a function defined in a code pod.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, React, GraphQL, WebSocket,

that supports scope-based Encapsulation. The module system manages the symbol
table above the language runtime. Thus, in order to support other programming
languages, a parser is expected to be built.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: an option to choose which language’s kernel to launch.

React. Although the Javascript kernel for Jupyter exists, it is impossible to
develop React apps in Jupyter due to the lack of package bundler support, e.g.,
webpack. Interactive development can be very useful for front-end development
thanks to the visualization capability. Thus, it is desired to develop React
kernels for Jupyter and CodePod, respectively.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: a React kernel for Jupyter that derives from Javascript
kernel, but with webpack support.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, React, GraphQL, WebSocket,

functionality for a platform, e.g. the extensions and marketplace of VSCode.
CodePod has a unique scope-based canvas interface, we would like to define and
implement an extension system and APIs.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: An extension system and APIs for extending CodePod. Demo

It is
pretty tedious and time-consuming. An automated layout algorithm will let
programmers focus on coding. It analyzes the code snippets to figure out the
dependencies between the cells and scopes, and implement various auto-layout
algorithms present the program structure clearly. Dependencies include the call
graph, data dependency, execution order, arrow-based importing, and manually
defined order.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: a call-graph and data-dependency analyzer and a set of
auto-layout algorithms.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, React, GraphQL, WebSocket,

and different library ecosystems. Thus, it is very attractive if the functions
of different programming languages can call each other. This need is especially
useful in CodePod where the smallest coding unit is a function instead of a
file. Here, the goal is to implement cross-language runtime calls by serializing
and standardizing input/output into ProtoBuffer.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: a cross-language runtime that supports calling functions
implemented in other languages.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, React, GraphQL, WebSocket,

This
project adds both integration tests and unit tests. In addition, we envision
three important features:</p><ol><li>abstract unit test modules over different programming languages.</li><li>UI and pipeline support in Canvas and scope-based interface.</li><li>Automatic unit tests generation. Unit tests are expensive to write and
maintain. Thus, we would like to automatically generate unit tests from
integration test runs by recording` the input/output of the functions.</li></ol><p>Expected Outcomes: a testing framework that allows users to write and run
integration tests and unit tests; an engine to automatically generate unit tests
from integration tests.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, React, GraphQL, WebSocket,

debugging. However, traditional breakpoint-based debugging is still useful for
debugging the internal logic inside a function, e.g., inspecting the variables
inside the loops. This project aims to support adding breakpoints in CodePod’s
code editor and implements actions such as step-into, step-out, and step-over.
Jupyter already has it, so we’d probably just adapt it for CodePod.

line, and enabling step-into, step-out, and step-over actions.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, React, GraphQL, WebSocket,

and other formats to help users migrate between them and backup projects
locally. When exporting to Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts, users will be
asked to choose an ordering criterion, e.g., the return of an external function
based on the call graph or the data dependency, the execution order, or the
user-assigned order, to map code cells hierarchically located on a 2D canvas to
a linear order. Pickling and loading a Codepod project to and from a local copy
shall also be supported.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: an importer and an exporter between Codepod and its own local
open format, Jupyter notebooks (<code>*.ipynb</code>), Python scripts (<code>*.py</code>), HTML
(exporter only), Markdown (exporter only) and PDF (exporter only). When
exporting, three ordering schemes shall be supported: calling an external
function, sorting cells based on execution order, and using user-assigned order.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, Python, React, GraphQL</p><p>Possible Mentors: Forrest Bao, Hebi Li</p><p>The expected size of the project: 175 hrs</p><p>Rating: Easy</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="properly-detailed-contextual-zoom-with-minimaptoc-navigation">Properly detailed contextual zoom with minimap/toc navigation<a class="hash-link" href="#properly-detailed-contextual-zoom-with-minimaptoc-navigation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Detailed Description: CodePod makes the structure of code clear thanks to its
built-in visualization. This project improves CodePod’s visualization capability
to the next level. In particular, we need to show users just the right amount of
information, verbose details shall be collapsed properly upon zooming out.
Besides, since code cells are laid out 2D, a new way is needed to visualize
their orders, e.g., via arrows. The order can be manually assigned by a user
(e.g., drag and draw) or by an external function (e.g., analyzing the call graph
or data dependency). Lastly, a minimap is desired to show users an overview of
where we are and can navigate to the right code &amp; scope through ToC jumping.</p><p>Expected Outcomes: Storing and retrieving the ordering information to and from
the database and visualizing the ordering in arrows using React-flow; allowing
users to assign orders to cells via drawing arrows in CodePod’s frontend and
saving the user-assigned orders to the database; selectively visualizing
upstream and downstream nodes of a selected cell</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, SQL, React, React-flow,

text, CodePod becomes a new documentation or publishing tool: the hierarchy of
texts is visualized in 2D rather than using fonts or indentations in a
conventional way. The goal here is to add collaborative features to CodePod and
to publish CodePod-made documents into interactive web pages.</p><p>Expected outcomes: Change tracker and comment (bubbles, not programming
language’s comments) in Codepod, collapsing and expanding scopes into and from
thumbnail icons, semantic search in the text (as easy as using sentence-bert)
with results highlighted and jumpable.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, HTML, React, React-flow</p><p>Possible mentors: Forrest Bao, Hebi Li</p><p>The expected size of project: 175 hrs</p><p>Rating: Easy</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="comment-and-suggest-edits">Comment and suggest edits<a class="hash-link" href="#comment-and-suggest-edits" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Detailed description: Online collaboration has been widely used in team working.
When we collaborate on document writing on Google docs, two features have been
shown to be useful: the comment and reply system, and the suggest editing where
others can review and accept or reject the suggestions. We believe such
collaboration features will boost the productivity of software development as
well. This project adds comments and suggests edits features to CodePod.</p><p>Expected outcomes: Users can select some text or node and add a comment; team
members can reply and resolve the comment. Users can also toggle on the
“suggests edits” switch, and the edits will become a suggestion marked with a
different color. Other users can leave comments and decide to accept or reject
the suggestions.</p><p>Skills required/preferred: Javascript/Typescript, HTML, React, React-flow</p><p>Possible mentors: Forrest Bao, Hebi Li</p><p>The expected size of project: 175 hrs</p><p>Rating: Easy</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/9-gsoc2023.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_mS5F" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/tutorial/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Tutorial</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_vrFS thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#scope-branching-version-control-system-vcs" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Scope-branching Version Control System (VCS)</a></li><li><a href="#scope-based-function-level-cicd" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Scope-based function-level CI/CD</a></li><li><a href="#scope-aware-language-kernels-for-javascript-julia-and-racket" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Scope-aware language kernels for Javascript, Julia, and Racket.</a></li><li><a href="#react-jupytercodepod-kernels" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">React Jupyter/CodePod kernels</a></li><li><a href="#a-scope-based-extension-system-and-apis" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">A scope-based extension system and APIs</a></li><li><a href="#auto-layout-of-code-cells-and-scope-boxes" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Auto-layout of code cells and scope boxes</a></li><li><a href="#cross-language-runtime" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Cross-language runtime</a></li><li><a href="#integration-test-and-automatic-unit-test-generation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Integration test and automatic unit-test generation</a></li><li><a href="#breakpoint-support-in-code-pods" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Breakpoint support in code pods</a></li><li><a href="#importing-and-exporting-between-codepod-and-local-formats-especially-jupyter-notebooks-and-python-scripts" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Importing and exporting between Codepod and local formats, especially Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts</a></li><li><a href="#properly-detailed-contextual-zoom-with-minimaptoc-navigation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Properly detailed contextual zoom with minimap/toc navigation</a></li><li><a href="#codepod-based-collaborative-documentation-and-publishing" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">CodePod-based collaborative documentation and publishing</a></li><li><a href="#comment-and-suggest-edits" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Comment and suggest edits</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/tutorial">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/codepod-io/codepod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_wgqa"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 CodePod, Inc.</div></div></div></footer></div>
